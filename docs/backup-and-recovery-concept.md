# Introduction

This document provides an in-depth understanding of software disaster recovery and backup strategies, their importance, and best practices for  implementation for the webank online banking project.

## What is Software Disaster Recovery?

Software disaster recovery (SDR) refers to the processes, tools, and policies designed to restore software systems, applications, and data to their functional state after a disruptive event. The goal of SDR is to minimize the impact of disasters on business operations by ensuring rapid recovery and resumption of services.

## Key Elements of SDR

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): A detailed roadmap for responding to and recovering from disasters.

- Risk Assessment: Identification and evaluation of potential threats.
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Determination of critical systems and the potential impact of their failure.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): Maximum acceptable downtime for systems.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time.

## What is Backup?

Backup refers to the process of creating and storing copies of data to ensure it can be recovered in case of data loss. Backups are the foundation of any disaster recovery strategy and are critical for mitigating risks associated with data corruption, accidental deletion, or ransomware attacks.

### Types of Backups

- Full Backup: A complete copy of all data.
- Incremental Backup: Copies only the data that has changed since the last backup.
- Differential Backup: Copies data changed since the last full backup.
- Mirror Backup: A real-time, exact replica of the original data.

## Importance of Disaster Recovery and Backup

- Business Continuity: Ensures uninterrupted operations even during crises.
- Data Protection: Safeguards sensitive and critical information.
- Compliance: Meets regulatory requirements for data security and availability.
- Cost Efficiency: Minimizes financial losses associated with downtime.
- Reputation Management: Maintains customer trust by ensuring reliability.

## Steps to Develop a Disaster Recovery and Backup Plan

1. Assess Risks
Identify potential threats such as hardware failures, cyberattacks, and natural disasters.
Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.
2. Define Objectives
Establish RTO and RPO for critical systems.
Prioritize applications and data based on business impact.
3. Develop a Backup Strategy
Choose the appropriate type of backup for your needs.
Determine backup frequency and retention policies.
Select secure storage solutions (e.g., cloud storage, off-site facilities).
4. Implement Disaster Recovery Solutions
Deploy failover systems and redundant infrastructure.
Use virtualization for rapid recovery of software environments.
Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure effectiveness.
5. Document and Train
Create comprehensive documentation of recovery and backup processes.
Train employees and stakeholders on their roles during a disaster.

## Best Practices

- Automate Backups: Schedule regular backups to avoid manual errors.
- Use Encryption: Protect backup data with robust encryption methods.
- Adopt a Multi-Site Strategy: Store backups in multiple geographic locations.
- Perform Regular Testing: Validate recovery plans through periodic drills.
- Monitor Continuously: Use monitoring tools to detect and address issues proactively.

## Technologies for Disaster Recovery and Backup

- Cloud-Based Solutions
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- On-Premises Solutions
- Network-attached storage (NAS)
- Storage area networks (SAN)
- Backup appliances (e.g., Dell EMC Data Domain, Veeam Backup & Replication)
- Hybrid Solutions
Combining on-premises and cloud-based strategies to leverage the strengths of both.

# Necessary Backups, How and Why to Back Them Up for webank

## 1. AWS EKS Cluster Configuration

- **Why:** Ensures that infrastructure changes (e.g., cluster config, resources) are recoverable in case of accidental deletion or drift.
- **How:** Store Terraform state in AWS S3 with versioning enabled.

## 2. ArgoCD Configuration

- **Why:** Allows quick restoration of application configurations, ensuring the system can be redeployed if ArgoCD is lost or corrupted.
- **How:** Store ArgoCD config in Git (manifests, Helm values). Take periodic snapshots of ArgoCD settings.

## 3. Helm Charts

- **Why:** Helm charts define the deployment structure of your applications, ensuring they can be redeployed or rolled back to a previous state.
- **How:** Store Helm charts in an S3 bucket or Helm repository.

## 4. GitHub Repository

- **Why:** GitHub repositories store your application code and configuration; having backups ensures the ability to recover code after an accidental deletion or compromise.
- **How:** Use GitHub backups or a self-hosted Git mirror. Enable branch protections.

## 5. Persistent Volumes (Databases, Storage)

- **Why:** Ensures that data is not lost during failures, enabling restoration of databases and persistent volumes to their most recent state.
- **How:** AWS EBS snapshots, AWS RDS backups, enable automated backups and point-in-time recovery.

## 6. Terraform State

- **Why:** Terraform state files track the infrastructure’s current state; backups and versioning ensure that you can restore or reapply infrastructure changes after failures.
- **How:** Store in AWS S3, enable versioning, use DynamoDB for state locking.

# Possible Disasters and Recovery Strategies for webank deployment

## 1. Kubernetes Cluster Failure (EKS Outage)

### **Cause:**

AWS EKS region-wide outage, misconfiguration, or accidental deletion.

### **Impact:**

Entire Webank application goes down.

### **Recovery:**

- Use Terraform to quickly recreate EKS in another region.
- Ensure your ArgoCD instance is redeployed with access to GitHub.
- Restore application state from backups (databases, persistent volumes).

## 2. Argo CD Failure

**Cause:**

Accidental deletion, misconfiguration, or credential loss.

**Impact:**

Deployment automation stops, causing delays in updates.

**Recovery:**

- Reinstall Argo CD using Terraform (`terraform apply -target=module.argocd`)
- Restore Argo CD applications (`kubectl apply -f argocd-apps.yaml`)
- Restore OIDC secrets (`kubectl apply -f argocd-secrets.yaml`)
- Ensure ArgoCD has access to GitHub and Kubernetes.

## 3. Data Loss (RDSFailure)

**Cause:**

- Accidental deletion
- AWS infrastructure failure

**Impact:**

Loss of application data.

**Recovery:**

- Restore RDS snapshot (`aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot`)
- Use AWS RDS backups for managed databases.
- Enable point-in-time recovery for critical storage.

## 4. Helm chart Corruption or Incorrect Deployment

**Cause:**

Bad Helm chart update or incorrect values in Helm configuration.

**Impact:***

Service crashes or incorrect configurations deployed.
**Recovery:**

Roll back to a previous Helm release (helm rollback <release> <revision>).
Use kubectl get events and kubectl describe pod to diagnose issues.
Validate Helm charts in staging before production deployments.

## 5. Terraform State Loss or Corruption

**Cause:**

Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) is lost or corrupted.
**Impact:**

Infrastructure drift, inability to track changes.
**Recovery:**

- Store Terraform state in an AWS S3 bucket with versioning enabled.
- Enable state locking using AWS DynamoDB.

## 6. GitHub Repository Deletion or Compromise

**Cause:**
Accidental deletion, repository corruption, unauthorized access.

### **Impact**

ArgoCD loses source of truth for deployments.
**Recovery:**

- Restore GitHub repository from GitHub backups or self-hosted mirror.
- Restrict access and enforce branch protection rules.
- Store Helm chart tarballs in an AWS S3 bucket as a backup.

# Backup and Disaster Recovery Implementation Plan for webank

## 1. Create an automated backup strategy script

- The script should be able to backup all necessary webank componenets.
- The script should be ran automatically and frequently base on webanks RTO and RPO.
- Add documentation

## 2. Create a recovery script

- The script should automate restoring from backups in case of a disaster.
- Create a versioned disaster recovery runbook which provides step-by-step instructions for recovering webank’s infrastructure in the event of a disaster.

## Conclusion

An effective backup disaster recovery and plan is not optional; it is a critical component of any organization’s IT strategy. By understanding the principles outlined in this document, businesses can build resilience against unexpected disruptions, protect their data, and ensure long-term success. Implementing these strategies requires commitment, regular evaluation, and adaptation to evolving threats and technologies.
