## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth understanding of software disaster recovery and backup strategies, their importance, and best practices for  implementation for the webank online banking project.

## What is Software Disaster Recovery?

Software disaster recovery (SDR) refers to the processes, tools, and policies designed to restore software systems, applications, and data to their functional state after a disruptive event. The goal of SDR is to minimize the impact of disasters on business operations by ensuring rapid recovery and resumption of services.

## Key Elements of SDR

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP): A detailed roadmap for responding to and recovering from disasters.

- **Risk Assessment:** Identification and evaluation of potential threats.
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Determination of critical systems and the potential impact of their failure.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** Maximum acceptable downtime for systems.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time.

## What is Backup?

Backup refers to the process of creating and storing copies of data to ensure it can be recovered in case of data loss. Backups are the foundation of any disaster recovery strategy and are critical for mitigating risks associated with data corruption, accidental deletion, or ransomware attacks.

## Types of Backups

- **Full Backup:** A complete copy of all data.
- **Incremental Backup:** Copies only the data that has changed since the last backup.
- **Differential Backup:** Copies data changed since the last full backup.
- **Mirror Backup:** A real-time, exact replica of the original data.

## Importance of Disaster Recovery and Backup

- **Business Continuity:** Ensures uninterrupted operations even during crises.
- **Data Protection:** Safeguards sensitive and critical information.
- **Compliance:** Meets regulatory requirements for data security and availability.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Minimizes financial losses associated with downtime.
- **Reputation Management:** Maintains customer trust by ensuring reliability.

## Steps to Develop a Disaster Recovery and Backup Plan

1. **Assess Risks:**
Identify potential threats such as hardware failures, cyberattacks, and natural disasters.
Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.

2. **Define Objectives:**
Establish RTO and RPO for critical systems.
Prioritize applications and data based on business impact.
3. **Develop a Backup Strategy:**
Choose the appropriate type of backup for your needs.
Determine backup frequency and retention policies.
Select secure storage solutions (e.g., cloud storage, off-site facilities).
4. **Implement Disaster Recovery Solutions**
Deploy failover systems and redundant infrastructure.
Use virtualization for rapid recovery of software environments.
Test recovery procedures regularly to ensure effectiveness.
5. **Document and Train**
Create comprehensive documentation of recovery and backup processes.
Train employees and stakeholders on their roles during a disaster.

## Best Practices

- Automate Backups: Schedule regular backups to avoid manual errors.
- Use Encryption: Protect backup data with robust encryption methods.
- Adopt a Multi-Site Strategy: Store backups in multiple geographic locations.
- Perform Regular Testing: Validate recovery plans through periodic drills.
- Monitor Continuously: Use monitoring tools to detect and address issues proactively.

## Technologies for Disaster Recovery and Backup

- Cloud-Based Solutions
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- On-Premises Solutions
- Network-attached storage (NAS)
- Storage area networks (SAN)
- Backup appliances (e.g., Dell EMC Data Domain, Veeam Backup & Replication)
- Hybrid Solutions
Combining on-premises and cloud-based strategies to leverage the strengths of both.

## Posible Backup and disaster Recovery options for webank online banking application

### **Backup Options**

#### **1. AWS Backup**

#### **Description**

AWS Backup is a fully managed service that simplifies and centralizes data backup across AWS services.

#### **Features**

- Centralized backup management for EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, etc.
- Policy-driven backup scheduling and lifecycle management.
- Cross-region and cross-account replication for disaster recovery.
- Automated compliance reporting.

#### **Use Cases**

- Backup of persistent data stored in EBS, RDS, and DynamoDB.
- Long-term retention and compliance reporting for sensitive data.
- Replication for disaster recovery across AWS regions.

#### **Limitations**

- No native support for Kubernetes resources.
- Reliance on S3 replication/versioning for S3 data backups.

#### **Integration**

- Use AWS Backup for managing persistent data backups.
- Tag resources like EBS volumes and RDS instances for automatic inclusion in backup plans.

---

### **2. Velero**

#### **Description**

Velero is an open-source tool designed for Kubernetes workloads, providing backup and recovery for Kubernetes clusters and persistent data.

#### **Features**

- Kubernetes-native resource backup (e.g., Deployments, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs).
- Cross-cloud support, enabling multi-cloud and hybrid deployments.
- Integration with S3 or compatible storage for backups.
- Backup scheduling and retention policies.

#### **Use Cases**

- Backup of Kubernetes manifests and configuration.
- Disaster recovery for Kubernetes workloads and PersistentVolumeClaims.
- Migration of workloads across clusters or cloud providers.

#### **Limitations**

- Requires additional setup and maintenance.
- Does not support AWS-native services like RDS or DynamoDB.

#### **Integration**

- Use Velero for Kubernetes-specific workloads and store backups in an S3 bucket.
- Complement AWS Backup for infrastructure-level data protection.

---

### **3. Combined Approach**

#### **Description**

A hybrid strategy leveraging both AWS Backup and Velero to cover Kubernetes resources and AWS services comprehensively.

#### **Features**

- Centralized backup of AWS-native services via AWS Backup.
- Kubernetes-native resource protection with Velero.
- S3 storage as a shared backup repository.

#### **Use Cases**

- Comprehensive protection for both AWS services and Kubernetes workloads.
- Disaster recovery scenarios requiring minimal downtime and data loss.

#### **Integration**

- AWS Backup handles infrastructure-level backups (EBS, RDS, etc.).
- Velero protects Kubernetes resources, storing backups in the same or replicated S3 bucket.

## **Disaster Recovery Options**

### **1. Terraform for Infrastructure Recovery**

#### **Description**

Reprovision AWS infrastructure using Terraform scripts to restore the EKS cluster and related resources.

#### **Steps**

1. Store Terraform state files in a remote, secure location (e.g., S3 with versioning).
2. Use Terraform to recreate the infrastructure in case of disaster.
3. Validate the new environment before restoring workloads.

---

### **2. ArgoCD for Application Recovery**
